 The system creates an interconnected network of organizations, enterprises, and roles
 that streamlines the coordination of charitable activities. Through role-based access control and
 workflow automation, it enables seamless collaboration between different stakeholders while
 maintaining data privacy and security. The platform facilitates cross-organizational and
 cross-enterprise cooperation, allowing resources to be shared efficiently across traditional
 organizational boundaries, ultimately increasing the impact of charitable efforts and reducing
 administrative overhead.
